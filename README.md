# Faker-API
To solidify the concepts of making our own api, we are going to create an api that generates a random user on a GET request. We will be using Postman to make our GET requests.

In this assignment, we will be using 2 javascript libraries to create a simple API that generates a User and/or Company depending on the route:

Express (Server)
Faker (Fake data generator)


Go ahead and follow the checklist below using the 2 classes below:

# User class
- _id
- firstName
- lastName
- phoneNumber
- email
- password

# Company class
- _id
- name
- address
- street
- city
- state
- zipCode
- country
